Dear Mr. Wang,
    I am very grateful to have been employed by you for the past two months as an editor for your magazine Design & Fashion.I appreciate the opportunity of having worked here with you and my other colleagues.The experiences I had here are ones I would never forget for my entire life.
    However, as a young man whose primary interest is in computer science rather than fashion design.I have found that my present job doesn't fall in with my previous training and strength.I have therefore decided to quit this job to pursue other opportunities that may conform better to my educational background.
    Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconveniences my leaving may cause.
